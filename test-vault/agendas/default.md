# Research Agenda

## Current Focus
Describe your current research focus here. What questions are you trying to answer?
What problems are you working on?

## What I'm Looking For
- What kinds of insights do you want Hedorah to surface?
- What types of experiments interest you?
- Any specific techniques or methods you're exploring?

## Constraints
- Available compute (e.g., "single GPU", "CPU only", "8x A100s")
- Time constraints (e.g., "experiments should take < 1 day")
- Other limitations

## Questions I'm Trying to Answer
1. Your first research question
2. Your second research question

## Not Interested In
- Topics you want Hedorah to deprioritize
- Areas outside your current scope

## Current Hunches
Share your intuitions and hypotheses here. Hedorah will look for papers
that validate, challenge, or extend these ideas.
