# Connections - The-Geometry-of-Prompting-Unveiling-Distinct-Mechanisms-of-Task

**Source:** [[The Geometry of Prompting: Unveiling Distinct Mechanisms of Task]]

## [[Category Manifolds]]
**Related to:**
- [[representation learning]]
- [[manifold hypothesis]]
- [[disentangled representations]]

Category manifolds represent how the model organizes semantic categories in embedding space, directly relating to how well-structured the learned representations are

## [[Statistical Physics Framework]]
**Related to:**
- [[energy-based models]]
- [[Hopfield networks]]
- [[spin glass theory]]

Applies concepts from statistical mechanics to understand collective behavior of neurons and emergence of computational properties

## [[In-Context Learning Mechanisms]]
**Related to:**
- [[meta-learning]]
- [[gradient descent in weight space]]
- [[Bayesian inference]]

ICL can be viewed through multiple theoretical lenses, with this work adding geometric/physical perspectives to existing algorithmic interpretations

## [[Task Interference]]
**Related to:**
- [[continual learning]]
- [[catastrophic forgetting]]
- [[multi-task optimization]]

The observed synergistic and interfering interactions between tasks connects to broader questions about how neural networks balance multiple objectives

## [[Representation Geometry]]
**Related to:**
- [[neural tangent kernels]]
- [[feature learning]]
- [[lottery ticket hypothesis]]

The geometric analysis of representations connects to fundamental questions about what neural networks learn and how they organize knowledge
